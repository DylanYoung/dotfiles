Dotfiles
========

The dotfiles of Dawson Reid.

## Installation
Run the following command in your Terminal.
Pre-requisits: Make sure that you do not already have any dotfiles installed a `$HOME/.vimrc`, as this will clone the repo and setup a symlink to that path.
#### 1) Clone via SSH:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:dreid93/dotfiles.git ; cd dotfiles ; ./install.sh
```
#### 2) Clone via HTTP:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dreid93/dotfiles.git ; cd dotfiles ; ./install.sh
```
